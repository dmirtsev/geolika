Dear visitor of the Swiss Ephemeris download area

We have lifted the previous download restrictions on ephemeris files.
Users are now permitted to download a maximum of 3000 ephemeris
files in 24 hours.

Downloading is the only way to acquire the asteroid files. They are
no longer available on cdrom.
